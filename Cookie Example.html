<h3>Disclaimer: This code is almost exactly the same displayed on w3 schools! As I was doing this assignment and was trying to follow along with the guide the code was not functioning properly. I was fairly confused on it because we've never really done any scripts for this class so far and I wasn't sure if we were expected to produce our own code or just understand the lessons on how the code works. Either way I wanted to make it clear that I wasn't trying to pass this code off as my own. I tried to make some edits and adjustments and left comments in a few places so I could have a better understanding of what is going on but everytime I tried to edit or play with the code a certain feature would stop working correctly. So if you have to give me no credit on the assignment then it is what it is, but I didn't want it to look like I was trying to cheat and I didn't want to submit nothing. </h3>
